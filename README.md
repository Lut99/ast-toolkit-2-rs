# ast-toolkit-2-rs
Collection of libraries for working with compilers in Rust.

Second iteration of the [(now deprecated) AST toolkit project](https://github.com/Lut99/ast-toolkit-rs). The first project was great, but ended up focussing around our own notion of diagnostics, spans and a parser-combinator library called `snack`. However, with [chumsky](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky) becoming a viable alternative, this iteration focusses to bring the same collection of features but now centered around that library.

Also, written for Rust 2024 :)
